                We are sophomore students at Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Pune.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                During this pandemic we faced a problem to how sync and figure out what all assignments are given my professors. We always used to miss the deadlines. 
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                It was a chaotic mess.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Then we found that others are facing the same problem as well. So, we came up with an idea of making a to-do list which will serve as a system to get on track of that all assignments we are pending.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                In ENLIST, all you have to do is add a task. It will automatically get synced in everyone's task listüòÅ. So, no need to hassle around asking which assignments are due.
